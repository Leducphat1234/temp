# SCREEN.EXE
*screen.exe* is just a project of mine that display a screen and we can move the mouse to draw on it
Pressing any key to exit the screen
Click any mouse button to clear the screen
The __circle.txt__ file contains the value of *radius* and *width* of the circle that display at the mouse position (default is *10 10* -> **10 radius** and **10 width**)
The __color.txt__ file will contains the list of color of the circle (default is the rainbow color)
